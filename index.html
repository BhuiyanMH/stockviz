						<p>Here, together we will be exploring how the economy reacted to the Covid-19 and the government measures to combat it. More specifically, we will be trying to assess the impact on the economy through the stock markets and also analyze how companies of different industries have reacted to Covid. </br> </br>

						Let's start with the overall view of stock markets of Asia, America, and Europe. The Asian market index is Hang Seng, and it is consists of China, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The name of the American index is S&P 500 whereas the European index is STOXX 50 EU. </p>

						<h4>Overall Stock Market Movement</h4>

							import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@bhuiyanmh/stockviz.js?v=3";
							(new Runtime).module(define, name => {
								if (name === "overall_index") return Inspector.into(".overall_index")();
							});
						</script>


						<p>We can see a consistent drop in the index of the Asian market as China implemented a lockdown in Wuhan from 23rd January 2020. Huge drops are seen in the American and European markets as they also started setting strategies to implement lockdown which started from the 3rd week of February to different weeks of March in different states and provinces. Now let's analyze the stability of the markets in detail.</p>

					<p>We can see that the markets become quite unstable during the early period of lockdown. After a while, they become more stable.</p>

						<h4>Tasks to be done: </h4>

						<ul>
							<li> Combining the lockdown data with the stock market data. For this reason, we will be using the data from the <a href="https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker</a>.</li>
							<li>Adding filter and market selection to analyze the details of a particular market during a specific period. Therefore, it will be two visualizations on this page, one with overall and another with a detailed view.</li>
